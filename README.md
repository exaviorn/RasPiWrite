# RasPiWrite

**Author:** Matt Jump

## About
RasPiWrite is a simple and easily modifiable Python script that automates the process of mounting an SD card and downloading and installing a Linux image for a [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org). 

This script is fully functioning on Mac OS X, and it now has at least working support for UNIX (Tested only on Ubuntu).

## Install

Either clone the git repository...

    git clone git@github.com:shinsyotta/RasPiWrite.git

...or download the zip file.

    unzip RaspiWrite.zip
    chmod +x raspiwrite.py

## Usage 

    sudo ./raspiwrite.py 

RasPiWrite supports all the distros currently on the [official Raspberry Pi Downloads](http://raspberrypi.org/downloads) page. The script will choose a mirror at random to help ease the pressure on the network.
