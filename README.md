# RasPiWrite

**Author:** Matt Jump

## About
RasPiWrite is a simple and easily modifiable Python script that automates the process of mounting an SD card and downloading and installing a Linux image for a [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org). 

Currently the script is only compatible with Mac OS X systems, mostly because Macs have no easy way of installing Raspberry Pi distros. The goal is to try to make the script universal for all UNIX-like systems over time.

## Install

Either clone the git repository, or download the zip file.

    unzip RaspiWrite.zip
    chmod +x raspiwrite.py

## Usage 

    sudo ./raspiwrite.py 

RasPiWrite supports all the distros currently on the [official Raspberry Pi Downloads](http://raspberrypi.org/downloads) page. The script will choose a mirror at random to help ease the pressure on the network.
